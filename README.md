## Getting started

To make it easy for you to get started with GitLab, here's a list of recommended next steps.

Already a pro? Just edit this README.md and make it your own. Want to make it easy? [Use the template at the bottom](#editing-this-readme)!

## Add your files

* [Create](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/repository/web_editor/#create-a-file) or [upload](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/repository/web_editor/#upload-a-file) files
* [Add files using the command line](https://docs.gitlab.com/topics/git/add_files/#add-files-to-a-git-repository) or push an existing Git repository with the following command:

```
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/earkevin11-group/earkevin11-project.git
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main
```

# Stages of my Terraform workflows

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.
volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
